Content of DATA

1. exposure_dry_phase.txt
Text file with the characteristics of each Baetis egg mass exposed to one dry phase duration. 
1 row = 1 egg mass.
	
Column    |                             Meaning                           |
hatch       |   Number of hatched eggs per mass                             |
unhatch     |   Number of fertilised unhatched eggs per mass                |
totegg      |   Number of fertilised eggs per mass                          |
prop        |	  Hatching proportion per mass                                |
flume       |	  ID of the flume in which the egg mass was located           |
sub         |	  ID of the substrate on which the egg mass was located       |
dry_time    |   Dry phase duration (h) for which the egg mass was exposed   |

2. R_script.R
